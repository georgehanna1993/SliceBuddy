Given the following print plan data (JSON), explain it to a maker in clear, practical steps.

Rules:
- Keep it short and structured.
- Mention: material, orientation, key slicer settings, and risks/mitigations.
- Be honest about assumptions and unknown geometry.
- Use bullet points.
- Do not invent printer-specific settings (no temps/speeds unless explicitly provided).
