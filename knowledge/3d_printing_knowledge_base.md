3D Printing Knowledge Base (FDM – Practical Rules)

Materials Overview

PLA
	•	Easiest material to print
	•	Minimal warping
	•	Brittle under mechanical stress
	•	Low heat resistance (~60°C)
	•	Best for decorative models and prototypes
	•	High cooling fan recommended

PETG
	•	Stronger and tougher than PLA
	•	Better layer adhesion
	•	Slightly flexible
	•	More prone to stringing
	•	Better temperature resistance (~75°C)
	•	Ideal for functional parts like brackets and holders
	•	Use moderate cooling (less than PLA)

ABS
	•	Strong and impact resistant
	•	High heat resistance (~95°C)
	•	Warps easily without enclosure
	•	Produces fumes
	•	Recommended for mechanical parts
	•	Enclosure strongly recommended

ASA
	•	Similar to ABS
	•	UV resistant
	•	Good for outdoor use
	•	Warping risk without enclosure

TPU
	•	Flexible material
	•	Print slowly
	•	Avoid aggressive retraction
	•	Difficult supports removal
	•	Ideal for flexible parts (gaskets, cases)

⸻

Orientation Rules
	•	Maximize bed contact area
	•	Avoid tall, narrow prints when possible
	•	Layers are weakest in Z direction
	•	For mechanical strength, align stress parallel to layers
	•	Reorient to reduce support use

⸻

Supports and Overhangs
	•	Most printers handle up to 45° overhang
	•	Bridges under 20mm often printable without supports
	•	Large flat overhangs require supports
	•	Tree supports reduce scarring on figurines
	•	Consider splitting model instead of heavy supports

⸻

Bed Adhesion

Use brim when:
	•	Model footprint is small
	•	Print is tall
	•	Printing ABS or ASA

Adhesion tips:
	•	Clean bed with IPA
	•	Proper first layer squish
	•	Slow first layer speed
	•	Correct bed temperature

⸻

Tall Print Stability

Tall prints may:
	•	Wobble
	•	Shift layers
	•	Detach from bed

Mitigation:
	•	Use brim (5–10mm)
	•	Increase wall count
	•	Reduce print speed
	•	Ensure tight belts and stable frame

⸻

Infill Guidelines
	•	Decorative prints: 10–15%
	•	Functional prints: 20–40%
	•	Mechanical load: 40%+
	•	Increasing walls often improves strength more than infill

⸻

Wall Count Guidelines
	•	2 walls: light decorative parts
	•	3 walls: general prints
	•	4+ walls: functional parts
	•	Tall prints benefit from increased walls

⸻

Warping Causes
	•	Uneven cooling
	•	Drafts
	•	No enclosure (ABS/ASA)

Mitigation:
	•	Enclosure
	•	Brim
	•	Stable ambient temperature

⸻

Stringing Causes (PETG / TPU)
	•	High temperature
	•	Wet filament
	•	Excessive retraction

Fix:
	•	Slightly reduce temperature
	•	Dry filament
	•	Tune retraction carefully

⸻

First Layer Best Practices
	•	Slight squish
	•	Slow speed
	•	Clean bed
	•	Correct Z offset
